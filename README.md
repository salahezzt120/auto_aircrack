# auto_aircrack_lab.py
⚡ Automated WiFi Handshake Capture & Cracking (for **legal lab testing only**) ⚡

## 📌 About
This Python script automates the process of:
- Enabling monitor mode
- Scanning for nearby WiFi networks
- Capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes
- Detecting EAPOL packets
- Attempting to crack captured handshakes with a given wordlist

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
sudo ./auto_aircrack_lab.py wlan0
```
⚙️ Requirements

Python 3

aircrack-ng suite

scapy (pip install scapy)

💻 Just finished a new cybersecurity automation project!  

I developed a Python script **`auto_aircrack_lab.py`** that automates WiFi handshake capture and cracking in a **controlled lab environment**.  

🔹 Key features:
- Automated scanning & deauthentication  
- WPA/WPA2 handshake capture & EAPOL detection  
- Handshake cracking with aircrack-ng & wordlists  
- Organized session results and logs  

This project helped me practice:
- Scripting with Python & subprocess handling  
- Using `scapy` for packet inspection  
- Automating penetration testing workflows

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational and authorized security testing only**. It should never be used on networks without permission.  

Excited to keep building more security automation tools as I grow in this field! 🚀

👉 Do you want me to create the **full GitHub repo structure with README + LICENSE + .gitignore** ready for upload so you just push it, or only the LinkedIn post text is enough?
